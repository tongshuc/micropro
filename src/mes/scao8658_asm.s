    @ As a starting point, this function implements the basics needed
    @ to determine if our A4 logic should be running.
    @
    @ You will have to add logic here for A4.

    @ Some useful notes
    @
    @ BSP_LED_On, BSP_LED_Off - same argument as BSP_LED_Toggle, sets
    @ the LED to ON or OFF as you tell it
    @
    @ How to delay: DO NOT use busy_delay - remember, this is an interrupt
    @ handler. If you need a delay, use a counter to count how many times
    @ this function has been called, and use that to skip a desired number
    @ of calls.


    @ ***** Get something
    ldr r1, =a4_is_running
    ldr r0, [r1]

    @ ***** Check something
    cmp r0, #0
    ble a4_skip

        @ This part below is skipped if A4 is NOT running. You will want to
        @ keep all your A4 logic inside here.
        @ DO NOT PUT LOGIC FOR A4 ABOVE THIS LINE -----------------------------

        @ Even within this logic, you should still take a philosopy of check
        @ things, do things, and store things - do not use delays of any sort,
        @ and only use loops if they are bounded (that is, guaranteed to end)

        @ ***** Do something
        mov r0, #0

        @ DO NOT PUT LOGIC FOR A4 BELOW THIS LINE -----------------------------
